## Objectives

When a user clicks the button, a joke is retrieved from the joke api. That joke is passed to a text to speech api and that will tell us the joke

## Things I learned

## Thought process

- Get jokes from joke api
- Store the joke in a variable to be used by the text-to-speech api
- Create a function that will deliver the joke to the text-to-speech api
- Add a click event to the button that will get the joke and make the joke be said by the text to speech api

## Need to refactor
